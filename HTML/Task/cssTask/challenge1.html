    <p class="first">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
        industry's
        standard
        dummy text ever since the <span class="red">1500s,</span> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type
        specimen book.<a href="#" class="heading2">Read more</a></p>

    <h2 class="heading1">Why do we use it?</h2>
    <p id="second"> is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
        looking at
        its layout. The point of using <span class="red">Lorem Ipsum,</span> is that it has a more-or-less normal
        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
